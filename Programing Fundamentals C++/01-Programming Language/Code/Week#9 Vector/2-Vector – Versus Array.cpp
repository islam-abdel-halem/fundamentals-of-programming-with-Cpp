/*
  Vector
  --- Vector vs Array

  - Vector
  --- It Need A Standard Header To Work
  --- Can Be Resized After Insertion Or Deletion Of Elements
  --- Not Index Based And Elements Accessed By Iterators
  --- Vectors Are Slower Than Arrays
  --- Vectors Occupy More Memory
  --- Available In C++ Only

  - Array
  --- C-Array Is Language Construct
  --- Cannot Be Resized After Its Defined
  --- Elements Accessed By Indexes
  --- Arrays Are Faster Than Vectors
  --- Arrays Occupy Less Memory
  --- Available In C & C++

  When To Use Vector
  --- When We Don't Know The Size Of The List

  When We Use Array
  --- When It Comes To Performance & Speed

  [1] After Learning Pointers There Will Be More Things To Compare
  [2] You Can Still Create Dynamic Array But Vector Is Better
