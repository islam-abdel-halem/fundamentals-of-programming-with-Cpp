/*
  Vector
  - Iterator

  --- Containers
  ------ Array
  ------ Vector
  ------ List

  --- What Is Iterators
  ------ Iterators Used To Point To Memory Address Of The Container

  --- Why We Use Iterators
  [1] Simplify The Code => No Need To See The Full Iteration On Containers
  [2] Support For Many Algorithms Like Sorting And Finding
  [3] Allow The Dealing With One Element Without The Need To Load The Full List
  [4] Work The Same Way With All Containers
  [5] It Reduce The Complexity And Execution Time Of The Application

  --- Syntax
  ------ Container<Type>::iterator IteratorName;

  --- Initialize
  ------ With Vector Syntax
  ------ With Auto Keyword

  --- Print
  ------ [*] Dereference => Dont Print The Iterator, Print What Its Point To

  --- Notes
  ------ This Is Not Pointer, We Will Talk About Pointer Later
